            At Kings Landing, Electrum undertook a comprehensive project to
            electrify 165 stalls with individual 32Amp circuits, installing 114
            EV chargers. This ambitious project required substantial electrical
            infrastructure to ensure each unit had dedicated EV charging
            capacity, exemplifying our capability to manage large-scale
            residential installations.

            The City of Lougheed is a prime example of how Electrum integrates
            advanced technology with community needs. We installed 38 public
            Level 2 chargers across four locations, activated by QR codes, and
            206 secure RFID residential Level 2 chargers in five residential
            towers. All chargers are managed through Electrumâ€™s Cloud Platform
            Dashboard, facilitating efficient billing, power management, and
            carbon credit accumulation.
