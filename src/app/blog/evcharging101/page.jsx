          <h4>Understanding EV Charging</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>What is EV Charging?</strong> EV charging is the process of
            replenishing the battery of an electric vehicle by connecting it to
            a power source. Similar to refueling a gasoline vehicle, EV charging
            is essential for maintaining the vehicle&apos;s functionality and
            ensuring it has enough range for daily use.
