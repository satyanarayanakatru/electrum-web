            Unlocking Canadian Federal and Provincial Rebates and Incentives for
            EV Charging Installations
          </h4>
          <p>
            As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain popularity, the need for
            robust charging infrastructure becomes increasingly critical.
            Fortunately, both the Canadian federal government and provincial
            governments offer a range of rebates, incentives, and grants to
            support the installation of EV charging stations. These programs aim
            to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation by
            reducing the financial barriers associated with EV infrastructure
            development. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate these
            opportunities and maximize your financial benefits.
