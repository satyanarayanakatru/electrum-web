          Unlocking Canadian Federal and Provincial Rebates and Incentives for
          EV Charging Installations
        </h4>
        <p>
          As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain popularity, the need for
          robust charging infrastructure becomes increasingly critical.
          Fortunately, both the Canadian federal government and provincial
          governments offer a range of rebates, incentives, and grants to
          support the installation of EV charging stations. These programs aim
          to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation by reducing
          the financial barriers associated with EV infrastructure development.
          Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate these opportunities
          and maximize your financial benefits.
